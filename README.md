Learning Angular js

Cutome filters
 1. Need to define FilterFactorFunction using Factory Design Patterns(a factory is a place in the code which produces the new objects and functions in the program). In angular we have to create factory to produce the filtering function.
 2. Register the Filter Factory with the module.
 3. Need to inject Filter to use it.
 4. Diff b/w $digest() and $apply i.e $digest use at the end of native js and does not throw any error while $apply use inside native js and throws error but always try to use native angular service.
